### Typography

Google Fonts was used to import the chosen fonts for use in the site.

* Mouse Memoirs – This font is inspired by vintage Mickey Mouse comics from the 1950’s and 1960’s. This font is to be used for the headings and questions on the site.

* Fresca – This font is to be used for the body of the site.

### Imagery

Special consideration had to be taken into account due to the subject of the site. I was very careful to ensure that any images used in the site were royalty free and did not breach any copyright.

### Wireframes

Wireframes were created for mobile, tablet and desktop using balsamiq.

### Accessibility

I have been mindful during coding to ensure that the website is as accessible friendly as possible. This has been have achieved by:
